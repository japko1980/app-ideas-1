# Newsletter- Signup

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

Almost every website has a newsletter and the cooresponding signup method. This project will force you to learn the behind the scenes of a simple form. 
This signup form should capture user information and store it in an email marketing audience leveraging the MailChimp API.

This code represents a simple newsletter sign-up form that utilizes the Mailchimp API to subscribe users to a mailing list. 
By building this project, one can learn how to:

1. Set up a web server using Node.js and the Express framework.
2. Use the body-parser middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
3. Use the Mailchimp API to subscribe users to a mailing list.
4. Handle success and failure responses from the Mailchimp API.
5. Implement basic error handling and redirecting in the event of a failed subscription.
6. Handle HTTP requests and responses.
7. Basic error handling

Overall, this project is a good introduction to building a basic web application using Node.js and interacting with third-party APIs. 

## User Stories
